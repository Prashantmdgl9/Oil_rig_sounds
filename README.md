# Oil_rig_sounds

We are living in the world of data and it is said that data is more expensive asset in today’s world than oil is.
Daily hundreds of peta bytes of data is collected at work sites in various forms such as audio, video, images, data tables etc
Out of all the datum at our disposal, audio is something that hasn’t been used much.


In the present work, we will use the sounds captured at oil rig sites and classify them in 10 different categories.
Such analysis can reinforce the initial estimates of the site engineers and can help them in quick decisioning.

We have built a deep convolutional neural network on the spectrogram that has been created from the audio files

The model works with an accuracy of 81%
